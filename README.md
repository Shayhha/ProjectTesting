# Bird Habitat Management App

This repository contains the code for a Bird Habitat Management App. The app allows users to create an account, manage cages, birds, and their offspring. It provides a convenient way to organize and track bird habitats and populations.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in to access their personalized bird habitat management dashboard.
- **Cage Management:** Users can add and manage cages within their account. Each cage represents a specific habitat for birds.
- **Bird Management:** Users can add birds to their cages, providing details such as species, age, and gender. They can also update birds as needed.
